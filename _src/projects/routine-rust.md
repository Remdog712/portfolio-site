# Routine Rust

## About the Project
I created Routine Rust for a project for a class in 3D Modeling as well as for an entry into the Behrend Yahn Spring Art Show in which it won "Best in Show" in the Digital Art category. I created the video from an interest in the Fallout game series and as a point to make on how Robotic Replacements may be affordable but often times lose the humanity in the products they create.
